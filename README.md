# Comparison_API

This is the front end and back end code for a 3rd year university web development project
It uses Node.js to create a server to host the website
The website uses web scrapers (https://github.com/benmanuel12/WebScrapers) to scrape trading card websites for the prices of Magic: The Gathering cards then uses Spring and Hibernate to upload the data to a SQL database
This code then uses Axios to make requests from the front end to the back end to fetch data from the database, search card names and display all scraped prices for specific cards.

Disclaimer: This project may no longer work due to the scrapers being incompatible with the website if the pages have changed. This code is not affected but is much less useful without the correct format of data.
