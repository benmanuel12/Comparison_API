REST API Plan

User can GET one of 2 representations of data
1 for the search page containing all cards whose name includes the string submitted in the search (and possibly an option to get all cards)
1 for the details page containing all options with the cardid that matches the cardid of the card whose page you are viewing

Possibly requires POST instead
No need to PUT or DELETE as the Java code handles the creation of data (and currently I'm doing the DELETEing by hand)
